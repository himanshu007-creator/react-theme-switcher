You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Deployment

    yarn build

Builds the app for production to the  `build`  folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### Bonus Feature:
Internationalization provides following features:
- detect the user language
- load the translations
- optionally cache the translations
- flexibility to use other packages eg: moment.js for date formatting
- scalability â€” option to separate translations into multiple files and to load them on demand
